About This Project

Welcome to the BeautyInBinary project repository! This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my journey transitioning from a successful career in cosmetology to the tech industry as a DevOps Engineer. The website highlights my skills, projects, and certifications, providing a comprehensive view of my professional development. I am integrating various AWS services to demonstrate my cloud computing expertise, including AWS S3 for hosting, CloudFront for content delivery, Lambda for serverless functions, API Gateway for managing APIs, and DynamoDB for scalable data storage. This project not only serves as a platform to present my work but also as a hands-on tool to deepen my knowledge and proficiency with AWS solutions. Future enhancements include adding dynamic content, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and exploring advanced AWS services to create a robust, scalable, and secure application.
