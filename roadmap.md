Phase 1: Set Up AWS Services

Step 1: Set Up an S3 Bucket:

Create an S3 bucket to store static assets (e.g., images, videos, documents).
Configure the bucket for public access if needed and set the appropriate permissions.

Step 2: Set Up AWS Lambda:

Create Lambda functions to handle backend logic or serverless processing.
Use AWS API Gateway to expose your Lambda functions as RESTful APIs.

Step 3: Set Up AWS CloudFront:

Use CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to speed up the delivery of your static content stored in S3.
Configure a CloudFront distribution and link it to your S3 bucket.

Step 4: Set Up AWS RDS or DynamoDB:

If you need a database, set up Amazon RDS (for relational databases) or DynamoDB (for NoSQL databases).


Phase 2: Connect AWS Services to Your Squarespace Website.

Step 1: Embed Static Content from S3:

Upload your images, videos, and documents to the S3 bucket.
Use the S3 URLs to embed these assets into your Squarespace pages. In Squarespace, go to the page editor, add an image or a file, and use the S3 URL as the source.

Step 2: Call AWS APIs from Squarespace:

Create Lambda functions and API Gateway endpoints for any server-side logic.
In Squarespace, use the Code Block to embed custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to call these APIs.

Step 3: Use CloudFront for CDN:

After setting up CloudFront with your S3 bucket, use the CloudFront distribution URLs to embed content into your Squarespace site instead of the S3 URLs. This will ensure faster load times and better performance.

Step 4: Connect to AWS RDS or DynamoDB:

If your site needs to fetch data from a database, set up an API (using Lambda and API Gateway) that interacts with your RDS or DynamoDB instance.
Call this API from your Squarespace site using JavaScript in a Code Block.

Phase 3: Secure Your Integrations
Step 1: Use IAM Roles and Policies:

Ensure your AWS resources are secured using IAM roles and policies. Only give necessary permissions to each service.

Step 2: Enable SSL/TLS:

Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage SSL/TLS certificates and secure your API endpoints.
Ensure your CloudFront distribution uses HTTPS.

Step 3: Monitor and Log:

Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance and logs of your AWS resources.
Set up alerts for any issues or performance bottlenecks.
